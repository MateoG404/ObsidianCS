## What is [[Block Ciphers]] in [[Cryptograhpy]]?

A **Block Cipher** is a [[Symmetric-key]] encryption scheme that breaks up the message into strings (blocks) of a length t over the [[Alphabets]] A ([[Notation used in Cryptography]])


Block ciphers' types
1. [[Substitution ciphers]]: Replace symbols by others symbols

2. **Transportation ciphers**: Permutes the symbols in a block

3. **Product ciphers**: Is a composite of permutation and transportation blocks
