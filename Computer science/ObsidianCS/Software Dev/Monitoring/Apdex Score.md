## What is [[Apdex Score]]?

Also, Known as ***(Application Performance Index)*** It's a standard industry to measure **users' satisfaction** with the response time of [[web applications]] and services.

The [[Apdex Score]] can be sorted in three big groups:

* **Satisfactory response time** : The response time is below the limit

* **Tolerable response time** : The response time is below threshold but less than four time for the threshold

* **Unsatisfactory response time:** This is for when response time is at or greater than four times the threshold.

## How to calculate the [[Apdex Score]]?

The formula to calculate the [[Apdex Score]]

$Apdex =\frac{Satisfactory + (0.5 \dot Tolerable)}{\# Samples}$

The reason for the formula is that the **Satisfactory** affect the score in a 100% and the Tolerable measure are response which are correct but not in the optimal time for that reasone contribute in a 50% in the measure
