## What is the [[Score]] in [[ElasticSearch]]?

This score indicates how well the document matches the query. Elasticsearch calculates this score based on various factors, including:

1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: This measures how often a term appears in a document. A term that appears more frequently tends to be more relevant.

2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This measures the uniqueness of a term across all documents. Terms that are common across many documents are considered less relevant.

3. **Field-Length Normalization**: Longer fields tend to have lower relevance than shorter fields. This normalization factor compensates for this effect.

4. **Term Proximity**: Terms that appear closer together in a document are often more relevant. Elasticsearch considers the proximity of query terms in a document.

5. **Field Boosts and Query Boosts**: You can assign boosts to specific fields or the entire query to increase or decrease the relevance of certain fields or terms.

6. **BM25 Similarity Algorithm**: Elasticsearch uses the BM25 similarity algorithm as the default scoring mechanism, which combines TF, IDF, and field-length normalization.

7. **Relevance Tuning**: Elasticsearch allows you to fine-tune relevance scoring through various settings and configurations.
