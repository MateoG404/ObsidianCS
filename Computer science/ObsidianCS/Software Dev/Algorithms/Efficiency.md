- In the last image we can see that the depends on the input size (n) is better to select the efficiency with O(n²) than the efficiency with O(log n) but after some size of n is better to select the [[Algorithm]] with the efficiency O(log n) than the [[Algorithm]] with the efficiency O(n²). For that reason, we have to be careful at the moment to choose an algorithm
