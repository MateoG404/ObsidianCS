## What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define how different components of software systems should interact, making it possible for developers to access the functionality of another application or service without needing to understand its internal implementation.
