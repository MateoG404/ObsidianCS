## What is the [[Huffman Algorithm]]?

It's an [[Algorithm]] used to optimize the [[Data Compression]] using the encoding length

## Algorithm

This algorithm is based in the [[min heap]] [[Algorithm]] because the main idea is had the min characters with the minimum size in the beginning of the queue
