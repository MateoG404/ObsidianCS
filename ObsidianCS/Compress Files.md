## Using tar [[Command]] to compress and decompress

**tar** is a [[Command]] used to compress files or directories using the option **-c** ***(Create)***. The sintaxis is:

	tar [OPTIONS] ['Name File Compress'] ['File to compress']

***Note: We can use a better [[Algorithm]] to compress called [[gzip Algorithm]]***

Also, we can decompress using the same [[Command]] tar with the option **-x** ***(extraction)***


## Using zip [[Command]]

It is the same that **tar**, but **zip** is used in other [[Operating System]] like Windows to **COMPRESS**.

To **DECOMPRESS**, we use the [[Command]] **unzip**
