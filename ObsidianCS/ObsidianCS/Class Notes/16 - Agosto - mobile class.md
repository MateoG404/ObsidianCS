* We create a prototype to show how our product works. It's not necessary that the prototype have all the funcionalities.

* We can make prototypes using:
	* Rapid model
	* Sketches
	* Wireframe (Could be an offline version of the app)
	* Physical model (Work the app in some way)

The last type of prototypes could be used in different cases that depends what we want to know.
