1. **Fast** : The test has to be fast to run and to create theirs
2. **Isolated** : All the test must be isolated of our code and the others test
3. **Repeatable** : All the times that we run the code that code must be the same output, that means the [[Unit test]] is [[deterministc algorithm]]
4. **Self-validating** : The test has to say if the functionality is working or not
5. **Thorough** (exhaustive) : All the cases have to be correct
