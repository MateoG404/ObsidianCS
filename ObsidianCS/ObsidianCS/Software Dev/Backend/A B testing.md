## What is A B Testing?

It is a method used to test a new product or [[feature]] in some application to understand which changes in the product produce the most important values.

The A/B Testing have two parts:
* Control (A) Is the original version
* Alternative (B) is the new version in the app

Both test have a [[Conversion Rate]]

## Why use an A B Testing?

* Get new data and relationship between the values as the time, moment of the year, the other companies and the impact of our new feature to get more things (sells, users, info, etc..)
* In the [[Software Engineering]] the A B testing is commonly used in some features related with generate personalized experiences
* Is related with the impact in the [[UX]]

## Benefits to use the A B testing

* The main benefit is to know which feature have the most positive impact to get a specific goal
* Derivate some resources for the most feature with the most impact


## Life Cycle

* Design : What and how would be the testing
* Implementation : How to implement the **A B testing** to get the data, results and create the static analytics
* Interpretation Data : Understand the results

## When use an A B testing?

* Uncertainty
* Complexity with the implementations of new features
* When the outcome of the A B testing is relevant
* When there is a new feature, and we want to know the impact

## Steps to design A B testing

1. Create a hypothesis

2. Know which metrics we are going to measure
3. Select the poblation where we are going to implement
4.
