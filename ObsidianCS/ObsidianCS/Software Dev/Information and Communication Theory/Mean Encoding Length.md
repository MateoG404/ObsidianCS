## What is the [[Mean Encoding Length]] ?


The mean encoding length is defined by the formula :
$L = \sum{ (P_{xi})n_i}$

Where :

* $n_i$ is the length of bits associated to the character
* $P_{xi}$ is [[Information Content]]


## Most efficient code

$\eta = \frac{L_{min}}{L}$

or  defined using the [[Entropy]] as

$\eta = \frac{H(X)}{L}$
