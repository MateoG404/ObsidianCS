## What is [[Data Compression]]?

It's the process to transform some data (original) in another data (result) to improve the quality or reduce the size of it

## Types of compression

1. Lossy : Reduces file size by permanently removing some of the original data.
2. Lossless : Reduces file size by removing unnecessary metadata

## Measure of Data Compression

1. RC ( Razon de compresion ) 
	$RC = \frac{Size After Compression Data}{Original Size}$

2. FC (Factor de compresion)
	$FC = \frac{originalSize}{compressionSize}$
