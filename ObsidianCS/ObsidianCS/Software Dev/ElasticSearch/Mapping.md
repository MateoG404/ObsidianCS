## How to [[Mapping]] in [[ElasticSearch]]?

[[Mapping]] in [[ElasticSearch]] refers to defining how documents and their fields are indexed and stored within the Elasticsearch cluster. Proper mapping is crucial for effective search and retrieval of data. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform mapping in Elasticsearch:

1. **Understand Your Data**: Before mapping, it's essential to understand the structure of your data. Identify the types of fields present in your documents and their data types (e.g., strings, integers, dates, etc.).

2. **Index Creation**: Ensure that you have created an index in Elasticsearch where you want to store your documents. You can create an index using the following API call:

    [[JSON]] code

    `PUT /your_index_name {   "settings": {     "number_of_shards": 1,     "number_of_replicas": 0   } }`

    Replace `your_index_name` with the desired name for your index.

3. **Define Mapping**: You can define mapping either implicitly or explicitly.

```Put
PUT /your_index_name
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "author": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "publish_date": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
