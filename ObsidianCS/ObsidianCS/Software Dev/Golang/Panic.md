(Errors that would never exist in our program)

When we are creating a [[Software]] sometime we have different behaviors that can be unexpected, in those moments we can use the [[Panic]] in [[GO]] to stop our program (similar to the [[Errors in Go]]). In [[GO]] there are native errors that create [[Panic]] like:

* Null receptors [[pointer]]
* Get incorrect index from array or [[Slices]]
* Index out of bounds
*
