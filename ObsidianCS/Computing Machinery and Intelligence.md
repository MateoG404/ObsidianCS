***"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"*** is a seminal paper written by [[Alan Turing]] in 1950. In this paper, Turing addresses the question of whether machines can possess human-like intelligence, proposing what is now known as the Turing Test to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.

Turing begins by discussing objections to the idea of machine intelligence, emphasizing that such objections are often rooted in misconceptions about the capabilities of machines. He argues that there is no fundamental reason why machines cannot imitate human intelligence, given the right programming and design.

Turing then introduces the concept of the "imitation game," which later became known as the [[Turing Test]]. In this game, a human judge interacts with both a human and a machine through text-based communication, without being able to see or hear them. The judge's task is to determine which of the two, the human or the machine, is communicating with them. If the judge cannot reliably distinguish between the human and the machine, then Turing suggests that we may consider the machine to possess human-like intelligence.

Turing addresses potential objections and counterarguments, including the "mind-body problem" and the limitations of machines in understanding context or making creative leaps. He acknowledges that machines might not truly understand or experience emotions, but argues that this is not a requirement for intelligence.

The paper concludes by discussing potential practical implications and challenges in building intelligent machines, such as the need for appropriate programming techniques and a deeper understanding of human thinking processes.

Overall, Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" lays the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence and raises important questions about the nature of intelligence, machine capabilities, and the potential for machines to exhibit human-like behavior.
