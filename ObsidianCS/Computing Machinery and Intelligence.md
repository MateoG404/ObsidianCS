***"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"*** is a seminal paper written by [[Alan Turing]] in 1950. In this paper, Turing addresses the question of whether machines can possess human-like intelligence, proposing what is now known as the Turing Test to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.

Turing begins by discussing objections to the idea of machine intelligence, emphasizing that such objections are often rooted in misconceptions about the capabilities of machines. He argues that there is no fundamental reason why machines cannot imitate human intelligence, given the right programming and design.

Turing then introduces the concept of the "imitation game," which later became known as the [[Turing Test]]. In this game, a human judge interacts with both a human and a machine through text-based communication, without being able to see or hear them. The judge's task is to determine which of the two, the human or the machine, is communicating with them. If the judge cannot reliably distinguish between the human and the machine, then Turing suggests that we may consider the machine to possess human-like intelligence.

Turing addresses potential objections and counterarguments, including the "mind-body problem" and the limitations of machines in understanding context or making creative leaps. He acknowledges that machines might not truly understand or experience emotions, but argues that this is not a requirement for intelligence.

The paper concludes by discussing potential practical implications and challenges in building intelligent machines, such as the need for appropriate programming techniques and a deeper understanding of human thinking processes.

Overall, Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" lays the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence and raises important questions about the nature of intelligence, machine capabilities, and the potential for machines to exhibit human-like behavior.

# **Principal ideas**
* The human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules;
* For [[Alan Turing]] the computer has to get three parts. Store, Executive Unit and Control.
* The store is the place where the computer store the information get from any operation
* For [[Alan Turing]] programming is the capability to make an appropriate instruction to do some task or solve a problem using the computer
* The machines or computer for [[Alan Turing]] are discrete-state machines, that means, the computers have a finite number of states, which we can predict the next states even if we only get the input.
* According to the last idea, we can solve the [[Turing Test]] using a discrete-state machine because if we know all the possible states and the inputs, we can create a machine how make the rules or the steps to solve the problem.
* [[Alan Turing]] give an important opinion about the theological aspect about the knowledge and the [[IA]] because in that time the people thought that the humans were the unique living beings that could think, but for [[Alan Turing]] think is not only for humans, the machine thinks also because can store, make operations and give a result according to specific information. 
* [[Alan Turing]] claimed if the humans can make math and get creativity, the computers also. Because the human brain could be seen like a computer who make operations and give results with a specific inputs (knowledge).
* The machines can express and feel feelings because, for Alan Turing, the feelings are an answer to some questions about ourselves.
* The consciousness exists in the machines because could be imitate like the humans if the machine have the capability to solve and understand problems and if can understand the language.
