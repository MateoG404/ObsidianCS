In [[Mobile dev/Flutter]], `ListView` is a scrollable [[Widget]] that arranges its children linearly, either vertically or horizontally. It is commonly used for displaying lists of items, such as a contact list or a to-do list. Unlike `ListView.builder`, the standard `ListView` constructor eagerly initializes its children, meaning it renders all of its child widgets at once. This approach is simple and straightforward, making it suitable for lists with a small and predefined number of items. However, it can be inefficient for long lists, as it consumes more memory and processing power to render all items simultaneously. Therefore, while `ListView` is excellent for scenarios where the list size is small and all items are known in advance, it may not be the best choice for more dynamic or extensive lists.

When we need to use a big list must use **ListView.builder**
