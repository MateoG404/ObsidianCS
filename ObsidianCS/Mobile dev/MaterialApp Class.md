# What is MaterialApp Class?

A convenience [[Widget]] that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for [[Material Design]] . It builds upon a [WidgetsApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp-class.html) by adding material-design specific functionality, such as [AnimatedTheme](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AnimatedTheme-class.html) and [GridPaper](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridPaper-class.html).
