## Structure Projects

There are three big different folders:

1. **Android** : If we want to configure or modify something in [[Android]]because [[Flutter]]it's a crossed platform for [[native applications]]
2. **IOS** : Same that Android
3. **lib** : All the files created in [[Dart]] used by [[IOS]] and [[Android]]


## File Configuration

The file **pubspec.yaml** is a configuration file where we can put some different aspects related to version, dependencies, fonts, assets etcâ€¦
