## What is StatefulWidget?

It's a [[Widget]] used in [[Flutter]] that is **immutable** which is immutable after it's created, meaning its configuration can't change over time. The main characteristic of a `StatefulWidget` is its ability to hold mutable state. This means you can have variables within the widget that change over time and can cause the [[UI]] to rebuild when they do.
