## What are control operators?

The control operations are reserved symbols in the [[Terminal]] that can help us to link different [[Command]]
Example : 
	Create a directory and print a cow saying hello

## Types of control operators 

1. ";" **Use more than one command**
2. "&" **Create commands like [[Threads]]**
3.  "&&" **Execute a command if the last one was executed correctly**

4. "||" **OR logical** different to "&"  because don't create [[Threads]]

## Example

We create a directory and go to that directory and create an file called "output.txt" and if the file was created correctly print a message and save it in the same file, but if something didn't run print "No"
