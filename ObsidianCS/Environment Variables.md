## What are the environment variables ? 

The environment variables are variables when the [[Operating System]] save important information about some scripts or configuration.

## Important environment variables 
	Note: To use an environment variable we have to use the symbol "$" before the      variable's name

1. HOME : It's the direction of the home folder
2. PATH : All the directions of the binary scripts of the computer

## Where is the information from the PATH variable?

In the file **.bashrc** and we can edit that information and create new [[Alias Command]]

### Example:
Add new bin folder for the PATH environment variables
