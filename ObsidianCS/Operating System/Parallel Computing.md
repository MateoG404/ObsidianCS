## What is Parallel Computing ?

Parallel computing refers to the [[Process]] of breaking down larger problems into smaller, independent - as [[Divide and Conquer]] in [[Algorithm]] - often similar parts that can be executed simultaneously by multiple processors communicating via [[Shared Memory]], the results of which are combined upon completion as part of an overall [[Algorithm]]. The primary goal of parallel computing is to increase available computation power for faster application processing and problem-solving.

To make a Parallel computing we need an architecture parallel, that's to say, we need a computer with [[multiple core]]

## Why Parallel Computing ?

* The [[clock speed]] haven't improved in the last years because the computers when have a high [[clock speed]] need to consume more energy to run. 

## Types of Parallelism 

* [[Parallelism bit-level]]
* [[Parallelism instruction-level]]
* [[Data Parallelism]]
* [[Task Parallelism]]
