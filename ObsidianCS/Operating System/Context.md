In [[Mobile dev/Flutter]], the context refers to the location of a [[Widget]] in the [[Widget tree]]. It provides information about the surrounding environment and services that the widget might need.


### Example

For example, the context can contain information such as the theme of the app, the locale, the screen size, and more. By accessing the context, a widget can make decisions about how to display itself based on the context.
