[[Software Architecture]] :

* Functional Requirements (Features & services offered for the users)

* Not-Functional Requirements (Attributes expected by the stakeholders)

* Technological Constrains (Technology used for the [[mobile applications]], we can have different **constrains** ([[Internet]], [[Operating System]], [[Memory]])

	* We need to optimize the use of [[Memory]] & [[battery]]

	 * We need to think about the different scenarios ***(not internet connection, low battery, not enough memory, etc ...)***

	* [[Software Dev/Backend/Quality Software]] matters more than the [[Software Architecture]]

* [[Software Dev/Backend/Quality Software]] : Some characteristics measurable or testable that tell us how the [[mobile applications]] solve the needs of the stakeholders
