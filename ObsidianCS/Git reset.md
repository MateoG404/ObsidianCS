## What is git reset?

It's a [[Command]] in [[Git]] that we use to return our **HEAD** version's code to a specific version. There are two different types of git reset, ***soft*** and ***hard***. The soft version save the changes charged in our [[Staging]] and return to the version that we put in the [[Command]]. And the hard version don't save the changes charged in the [[Staging]] and only return to the version.
