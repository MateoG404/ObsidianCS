> **Definition:** The NP-Complete Problems or also known as **[[Nondeterministic]] Polynomial-time Complete** refers to those problems that don't have an efficient solution known. In other words, we haven't found an [[Algorithm]] which can solve the problem for all the cases efficiently.

### Properties of NP-Complete Problems #flashcard 

* For a set of NP-Complete Problems exists an [[Efficiency]] solution, then exists an [[Efficiency]] [[Algorithm]] to all the problems
* If we have a [[Certificate]] that means that the problem could be [[Tractable Algorithm]]


## Examples of NP-Complete Problems
