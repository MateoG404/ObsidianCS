* At the beginning of 2022, when the pandemic was finally coming to an end, the challenge for Familia Torres was defining a sustainability strategy for the future

* Regenerative agriculture proposed practices diametrically opposed to conventional agriculture, with the promise of regenerating soils, recovering biodiversity and the local water cycle, increasing the resilience and productivity of the land

* In 2022, the company was divided into four business units
	1. The unit responsible for the production and marketing of its wines, brandies, and wine distillates ***(where in wines accounted for 70 per cent of sales and brandies for 30 per cent.).***
	2. Food, through the marketing of select products, premium olive, oil and “delicatessen”. 
	3. The third unit was focused on the development of business related with wine tourism and restoration. 
	4. The fourth was responsible for management of the company's winery in Chile.

* In 2021, the company achieved sales of 255 million euros, with wine sales in more than 100 countries and approximately 1,200 workers

* The Torres & Earth18 program was designed to drive measures that would help minimise the effects of climate change and give other wineries an incentive to join forces in the fight against global warming.

*  The winery set itself the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions per bottle by 30% from 2008 to 2020

* The ultimate aim was to become a winery with zero emissions by 2040.

* The Torres & Earth program was underpinned by three pillars: mitigation, adaptation and raising awareness.

* The mitigation tasks are :
	* Renewable energies
	* Energy effiency  ***(projects based on bioclimatic architectur)*** 
	* Sustainable mobility 
	* Forest management and reforestation
	* Average weight of wine bottles
	* Capturing and reusing CO2 

* The task of adaption are:
	* wine growing techniques
	* new sites where the climate is the coolest
	* ancestral varieties
	
 * International Wineries for Climate Action (IWCA)
 
 * President Miguel A. Torres says, “the more we care for earth, the better our wine.” 
  
 * More resilient soils could reduce the number of unbalanced wines with overripe aromas; more fertile soils could produce wines with a fresher, more elegant character; and wines could be more consistent over time, less affected by climatic variability

## Summary 

"Familia Torres: From Sustainability to Regenerative Agriculture" provides an in-depth exploration of the transformation undertaken by Familia Torres, a prominent winemaking family from Spain. The text chronicles their journey from an initial commitment to sustainable practices towards a more advanced paradigm of [[regenerative agriculture]].

The narrative underscores how the family enterprise progressively evolved its environmental strategies. While sustainability aimed to reduce negative impacts, regenerative agriculture takes a more comprehensive approach by actively revitalizing and improving ecosystems. Familia Torres embraced this transition by incorporating a range of innovative practices.

The family's shift towards regenerative agriculture involved multifaceted strategies. They prioritized biodiversity, actively fostering a diverse range of plant and animal species within their vineyards. This approach not only benefited the local ecosystem but also enhanced the resilience of their crops.

Moreover, Familia Torres placed a strong emphasis on soil health. Through measures like cover cropping, minimal soil disruption, and compost application, they sought to enrich soil biology and structure. This not only boosted grape quality but also contributed to carbon sequestration, mitigating the farm's carbon footprint.

The winemaking family combined cutting-edge technology with traditional wisdom. They employed modern techniques such as precision viticulture, which utilizes data to optimize farming practices. Simultaneously, they integrated age-old practices like sheep grazing in their vineyards, tapping into historical agricultural wisdom.

The significance of Familia Torres' journey extends beyond their own operations. Their story serves as a prime example of a larger trend towards sustainable business practices, reflecting a global shift towards ecologically conscious approaches. Their success in implementing regenerative agriculture offers inspiration and insights for other industries to follow suit.

In essence, "Familia Torres: From Sustainability to [[Regenerative Agriculture]]" is a compelling account of a family-owned winery's evolution from conventional sustainability to a more advanced and holistic practice of regenerative agriculture. It demonstrates how a dedicated commitment to environmental well-being can lead to not only reduced harm but also active restoration and enhancement of the environment.
