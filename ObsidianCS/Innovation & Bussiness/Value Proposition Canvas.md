## What is Value Proposition Canvas?

It is a [[Framework]] created to show how a [[service]]  or [[product]] is positioned around what the costumer needs. Sometimes we need to create a **value** that is a set of benefits that we design to attract customers.

## Customer Profile

It's a way to describe our costumer with more details knowing the gains, pains and [[customer jobs]] 


## Value Map

It's a powerful map used to show how a **value proposition** help us to solve pain, generate creators to our users and know the list of products and services.
