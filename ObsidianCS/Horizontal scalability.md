## What is horizontal scalability?

Horizontal scalability involves adding more [[Virtual Machines]] or [[Server]] to the system to distribute the workload. This approach aims to achieve better performance and accommodate increasing demands by distributing the load across multiple machines. [[Cloud]] computing and virtualization make horizontal scaling more feasible. Adding more servers to a load balancer to handle increased traffic is an example of horizontal scaling.

## Advantages
* **Less cost**
* **Downtime** (Turn on/off the [[Server]] when it's needed)
* **Load balancer** (Balance the [[request]] around the servers)![[Pasted image 20230828111509.png]]
