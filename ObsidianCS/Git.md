## What is GIT?

It's a [[System control version]] created to save the information changed in our projects, get old version of our code and get a register of the changes about who and when were made.

## Characteristics
1. [[System control version]]
2. Branch : Work in specific homework without transforming all the files in the repository
3. Collaboration
4. Security: All the changes are saved because GIT have three states (stage, commit, modified)

The repository always exists in the field **./git**
