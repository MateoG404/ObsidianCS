## What is a [[Request]]?

When we are using the [[HTTP]] protocol to communicate, we need to create a [[Request]] that are the petitions we send to the [[Server]].

## Principle structure

The main structure to create a [[Request]] need the next items:

* **Method** : This method contains the verbs for the petition (Get, Post, Put, Delete)
* [[URL]] : It's the name of where we gonna access using the [[Endpoint]]
* **Version**: The version of the [[HTTP]]
* **Header** : It's the place where we put the [[Cookies]] values, [[token]] or [[PAT (Personal Access Token)]] and the others values that are important for the request
* **Body** : Are the data in a [[JSON]] format used in the [[Request]]
*
