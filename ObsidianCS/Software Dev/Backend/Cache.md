## What is cache?
Cache is a high-speed storage area that stores copies of frequently accessed or recently used data, files, or instructions. The purpose of a cache is to improve the efficiency and speed of data retrieval and processing by reducing the need to fetch data from slower and more distant storage locations, such as main memory or disk storage.
