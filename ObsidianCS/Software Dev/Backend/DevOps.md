## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to enable organizations to deliver high-quality software more rapidly, efficiently, and reliably. It bridges the gap between development and operations by promoting collaboration and automation throughout the software development lifecycle.
