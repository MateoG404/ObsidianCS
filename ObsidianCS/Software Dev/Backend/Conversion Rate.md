## What is a conversion rate?

Is the measure value of users who used the tests (A or B) from the [[A B testing]] given in a percentage scale

$ConversionRate=\frac{\#Success}{\#Sessions}$


In the real world to know which version is better, we use the **Change Rate**

$ChangeRate=\frac{\#ConvertionRate_{treament} - ConvertionRate_{control}}{ConvertionRate_{control}}$
