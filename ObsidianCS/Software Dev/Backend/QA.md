Quality Attributes, is a field of the Software Engineering where measure the indicators that say if our product is secure and can run in some scenarios

A good quality attribute must be measurable:

- Reliability (Measure if the product is reliable enough to sustain in any condition)
- Maintainability (Different versions of the product should be easy to main)
- Usability (This can be measured in terms of ease of use)
- Portability (The application should be correct in terms of functionality)
- Correctness (The application should be correct in terms of its functionality)
- Efficiency (It's a measured that indicates how many times is requeried to complete any task)
- Testability (The system must be easy to test and find defects)
- Integrity and security
- Flexibility (Should be easy and flexibility to modify)
- Reusability (Reusability the code)
- Interoperability (Easy to exchange data or services with other services and systems)

## Testing

In [[Software Development]] testing is a process to test if the software meets performance and usability requeriments

There are two types of testing : Manueal and Automated
