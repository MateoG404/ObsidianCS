## What are the Path Parameters?

When we are creating an [[API]] we create a [[Get Method]] we use the parameters to get specific information in the [[Request]], these parameters are in the [[URL]].

Sometimes the path parameters are not enough, for that reason we have to use the [[Query Params]] to improve our [[Request]]
