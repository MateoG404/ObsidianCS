## What is Software Architecture?

When we are creating apps or [[web applications]] we need to define or use rules and patroness to develop, maintenance and fix our applications.

The [[Software Architecture]] define the [[Server]], technologies, [[Data Bases]] and the other things that we use in the [[Backend]] and [[Frontend]]. Another advantage of create a good [[Software Architecture]] is that we need to [[Software Dev/Backend/Scalability]] our projects, that means we need to think constantly how to improve our service and how to grow the app using new technologies

## Steps to define a good architecture

We have 4 principal moments that we need to use to solve ours app's problems.

1. [[Requirements]] : In this part of the project we collect all the data about the user ex [[Personas]]
2. Design : This is the most crucial moment because we need to define the technologies will use in the future and the [[Software patterns]]
4. [[Documentation]] : We need to create a documentation for all the team
5. Evaluation

## Types of [[Cloud]] computing architectures

1. [[IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service]]
