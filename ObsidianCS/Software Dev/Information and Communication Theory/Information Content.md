## What is [[Information Content]]?

Sometimes we need to know the measure of how a data or symbol indicates the level of information that give us.  For that reason we use the formula

$I_{x}= - log_{2}(P_{x_{i}})$

Where :
	$I_{x}$ Level of information
	$P_{x_{i}}$ Probability Distribution ($\frac{Total frequencyOfData}{TotalData}$)
