## What is the principle [[ACID]]?

The principle [[ACID]] in [[Data Bases]] was designed to guarantee the [[Request]] and the use of [[Data Bases]] in the real World

## A (Atomicity)

Atomicity refers to do all the transactions ([[Request]]) atomic that means that all the [[Process]] involved had to be executed in a right way, if not, the Request can't be executed.

Ex: A request to get the money in the bank, all the process have to be solved and executed in a good way

## C (Consistency)

Consistency is the rule created to verify and guarantee all the rules to use the [[Data Bases]]

## I (Isolation)

All the [[Request]] must be executed in isolation in a sequential or in [[Parallelism]] way

## D (Durability)

The [[Data Bases]] after do some [[Request]] must store the changes and the different consults.
