## What is [[KVS Data Bases]] [[Data Bases]]?

**KVS DB** typically stands for **"Key-Value Store [[Data Bases]]."** A Key-Value Store is a type of [[NoSQL]] database that stores and retrieves data as key-value pairs. In this database model, each data entry consists of a unique key and its corresponding value. This simple and efficient structure allows for fast and scalable data access.

The main aspects for the KVS are :

1. **High Performance:** Key-Value Stores are designed for high-performance read and write operations. This makes them suitable for scenarios where quick data retrieval is crucial.

2. **Scalability:** Many Key-Value ([[Map]]) Stores are designed to be highly [[Horizontal scalability]] meaning that as the amount of data increases, you can easily add more nodes or servers to handle the load.

3. **Use Cases:** Key-Value Stores are commonly used for [[Cache]], session storage, configuration management, and scenarios where quick data access is more critical than complex querying.


Popular examples of Key-Value Store databases include:

- **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store, often used as a cache or message broker.

- **Amazon DynamoDB:** A managed NoSQL database service by Amazon Web Services that supports key-value and document data models.

- **Apache Cassandra:** A distributed NoSQL database known for its scalability and high availability, which also supports key-value pairs.
