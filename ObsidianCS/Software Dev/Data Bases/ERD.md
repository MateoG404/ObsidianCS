## What is a [[ERD]]?

* ERD (Entity Relation Diagram)

A [[ERD]] is a diagram used in the [[Data Bases]] to show the structure of a [[SQL]] DB where all the [[Tables]] have **Entities** and **Relations** with another [[Tables]]

We can make the relation using [[Primary and Foreign Keys]]

## Relations between the [[Tables]]

We can have different relations:

1. One to One (One table related with another table)
2. One to Many  (One table related with many tables)
3. Many to Many (Many tables related with Many tables, in this case we need to have an intermediate table using [[Primary and Foreign Keys]])
