## Types of Kernels ? #flashcard

* **Monolithic Kernel :** It's the principal kernel that all [[Operating System]] has and the biggest
* **Micro Kernel** : It's a secondary kernel used when the Monolithic Kernel fails down, but this type of kernel doesn't have all the safety permits.
* **Hybrid Kernel** : It's the mix between the Monolithic kernel and the Micro Kernel
