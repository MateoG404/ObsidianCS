## What is grep ?

It is a [[Command]] to search information within a file, similar to the [[Search Commands]] and [[Regular expressions]]. An important announcement is that there is another [[Command]] to search information within the files and is called **egrep**. The big difference is that **egrep** is better than **grep** because we can create more complex [[Regular expressions]].

The sintaxis to use **grep** is
	grep **\['pattern'] \['file']**

#### Example:

The [[Command]] could be **case-sensitive**, that means that the upper and lower letters are the same using the option **-i**
