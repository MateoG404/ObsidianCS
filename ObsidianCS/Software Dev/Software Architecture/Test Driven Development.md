## What is the [[Test Driven Development]]?

It's a paradigm used in the [[software developer]] to design solutions where first the [[Unit test]] are development and after the code for the application is created according to the [[Functional Requeriments]], [[No Functional Requeriments]], [[User story]] and [[Unit test]].

This type of paradigm is useful for developing quick solutions in a good way because we are sure of code integrity and security.
