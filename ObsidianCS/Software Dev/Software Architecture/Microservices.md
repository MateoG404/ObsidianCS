## Main characteristics 

* Independent and Autonomous 
* Focus in one task (Specialized to do some specific functions)
* SSOT ( Single Source of Truth) that means [[Microservices]] have only one [[Data Bases]] related for each [[Microservices]]
* [[Software Dev/Software Architecture/Scalability|Scalability]] could be [[Horizontal scalability]] or [[Vertical scalability]]


## Advantage
* Agility 
* [[Software Dev/Software Architecture/Scalability|Scalability]]
* Easy implementation
* Maintenance 

## Disadvantage
* More use of [[Memory]]
* Hard to do [[Testing]]
* Investment of time in the first moments to design the [[Microservices]]
