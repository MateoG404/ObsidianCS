When we are using [[Git]] and we have a complex project we need to create different [[Branch]] to develop our project, and we need to mix them [[Branch]] to the **master** in one moment of the development's project, so we use the [[Command]] **git merge** to do that. We use the merge command in the branch that we want to get the changes from the other.
