We used to move a branch from a specific moment or commit in the history.

When we are in our local [[Repository]] and we made mistakes we have to solve it using a [[Git]] **rebase** that is the way to create a **temporal** [[Branch]] to solve the bugs and [[Merge]] with the branch and copy the historical commits into the original [[Branch]] and delete the temporal.
