To change the privileges, we use the [[Command]] "chmod" ***(Change Mod)*** with the next symbols
1. u - Only for users
2. g - Only for group
3. o - Only for world
4. a - For everyone

## How to change between users ?

We can change between the users using the [[Command]] **"su"** (Switch user) in the [[Terminal]]. And the [[Command]] "sudo" give us all the [[Privileges]] but we don't log in like **root**
