## What are redirect ? #flashcard 

* When we are running a file or a program, it prints some in the [[Terminal]], and sometimes we want to save that information in a file. To do that we use a redirection of the information using the [[Command]] "> name file)" and if we want to concatenate the information we use the command ">> (name file)", both for the **standard input** and **standard error**
* If we want to redirect **stdout** or **stderr** we have to use the [[Command]] **2>&1** at the end to save that information
