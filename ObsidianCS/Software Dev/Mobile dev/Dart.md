## Advanced data types

* **Var** We can use var as a [[Wildcards]] to guess the type of data that we are using, but, it's always better to know the specific type of data that we are using.
* **final** It's a datatype used only for reading and can't be changed.
* **const** It's similar to final, but this type must be known in compilation time.
* **dynamic** This datatype is similar to **var** and we can change the type of variable along the time.
