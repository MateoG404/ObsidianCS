## What is an algorithm? #flashcard 

> **Definition**: Something in **computer science** that has inputs and outputs related between them.  
> The speed is the measure of an algorithm

* An algorithm is a tool in **Computer Science** to solve problems in the real life.
* An algorithm is correct if each input is related with a correct output, but also, exists algorithms that are partially correct because not all the inputs are related with a correct output
* The study of algorithms not depends on the computers


## Why are important the Algorithms? #flashcard 

The algorithms are important even if we had a computer memory free and infinite resources because when we study algorithm we try to demonstrate if an algorithm will have correct outputs and end in some moment. 

### Example

Given the list <6,8,5,3,2,0> you have to sort

	Input : <6,8,5,3,2,0>
	Output : <0,2,3,5,6,8>

## Analyze of Algorithms 

Select an algorithm to solve a problem sometimes could be difficult, for that reason we have to analyze them in order to find the best algorithm according to the follow items

* Input Size 
* [[Running Time]] 

### Why analyze Algorithms ? #flashcard 

- [[Software Dev/Algorithms/Scalability]]
- Know about the behavior of the Algorithm in the best, worse and average-case 
* To describe the Algorithm behavior we use the [[Asymptotic Notation]]
