## What's a Recurrence relation ? #flashcard 
In some [[Algorithm]] we need to do a recurrence to solve the problem, that means we have to run the same function many times but with different inputs. 
Mathematically the **recurrence relation** is expressed by:
	â‡¾ $T(n)= a T(n/b)+ f(c)$
	Where 
		n : Inputs size
		a : Number of sub problems recurrence
		$\frac{n}{b}$ : Size of each subproblem 
		$f(c)$: Cost of make a call recursion
