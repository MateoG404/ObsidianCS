[[JSON]], which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript [[Programming Language]], Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is often used when data is sent from a [[Server]] to a [[web]]. It is "self-describing" and easy to understand. JSON objects are written in key/value pairs and its keys must be strings and values must be a valid JSON data type (number, string, object, array, boolean or null). For example:

```json
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```
