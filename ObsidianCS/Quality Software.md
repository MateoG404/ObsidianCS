## Functionality Suitability
* Functional Completeness: **Full implemented features / Design** 
* Functional Correctness: **Behavior features [[mobile applications]] does what we want** (Functional [[Testing]])
* Functional Appropriateness : **How the features solve the problems** (user [[Testing]] )

## Performance Efficiency
* Time Behavior → [[Execution Time]], [[Running Time]] around the different features
* Resource utilization → [[Memory]], [[Storage]], [[internet]],[[CPU]],[[battery]], [[network]] and how we use and optimize to minimum uses
* Capacity → How we do ... (Amount of users, networks, [[Process]]) *The limits of our [[mobile applications]]* and 

## Compatibility

* Co-existence →
* Interoperability →How the app interacts with others [[mobile applications]]

## Usability

* Learnability → How the user learn how to use the [[mobile applications]]
* Appropriateness Irreconcilability →How the user recognize the features
* Operability->How the app works for the user
* User error protection -> Minimize user's errors when they is using the app
* [[UI]] 
* [[Accesibility]] -> What type of users can use the [[mobile applications]], related with the [[UI]]

## Reliability 

* Fault Tolerance -> What happened if the [[mobile applications]] failed? Some features can work at the same time ( not necessary [[internet]]) / [[Chaos testing]] 
* Maturity -> How the app works and how can growth around the time
* Availability -> Similar to [[Accesibility]]

## Security

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Authencity
*
