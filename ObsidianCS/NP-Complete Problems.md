> **Definition:** The NP-Complete Problems or also known as **[[Nondeterministic]] Polynomial-time Complete** refers to those problems that don't have an efficient solution known. In other words, we haven't found an [[Algorithm]] which can solve the problem for all the cases in a efficient way.


## Properties

* For a set of NP-Complete Problems exists an [[Efficiency]] solution, then exists an effiety [[Algorithm]] to all the problems
* 

## Examples of NP-Complete Problems

- The travelling-salesman problem
