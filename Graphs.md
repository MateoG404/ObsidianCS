	* Method used to represent a graph using a matrix
	* The sum of all the rows is the number of the edges when its a directed graph
	* The sum of all the rows is the two times of the number of the edges in a undirected graph
	* To represent a graph in a adjancecy matrix we need $\Theta{(VÂ²)}$  because in the best and worst case we need to visit the matrix $V * X$ times
